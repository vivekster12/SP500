## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# load csv
```{r}
sp500_training_complete<-read.csv("/home/vivek/Documents/sandbox/SandPTrial/S-PTrial/GSPC.csv")
```


# init plot
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(sp500_training_complete, aes(x=Date, y=Close, group=1)) + geom_line()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
